<h1>Lynda.com Network Notes</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Network topology:
    <ul>
      <li>web server outside the firewall</li>
      <li>untrusted classroom network inside the firewall</li>
      <li>mostly-trusted corporate network inside</li>
      <li>financial network centered around FileMaker server, but with
      some components on web server</li>
       </ul></li>
  <li>Goals:
   <ul>
    <li>No one outside the network should be able to snoop traffic inside</li>
    <li>No one outside the network should be able to communicate with anything
    e xcept one machine using DNS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP</li>
    <li>No one should be able to hit other machines through that one box</li>
    <li>Especially no one outside the network should be able to snoop login 
    data or financial data to/from the web server</li>
    <li>No one on the classroom network should be able to get access to the 
    corporate network except for restricted access to the file server</li>
    <li>No one in the mostly-trusted network should be able to snoop other 
    traffic or get financial data</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Actually implemented:
  <ul>
    <li>Well, if the firewall worked perfectly no one should be able to snoop 
    traffic inside, and it was pretty good</li>
    <li>Classroom network was in no way save physically segregated from rest 
    of network; this might have been good enough for stupid FileMaker</li>
    <li>Everybody and their sister had FileMaker logins</li>
    <li>Order data was sent through PGP encrypted email, and conference 
    financial retrieval was through HTTP over SSL, but order data was 
    retrieved via cleartext protocol--didn't involve credit card data, 
    though</li>
    <li>Web monkey tools insisted upon using plaintext FTP, which is an 
    absolute bear to secure, so we didn't</li>
    <li>Holes opened in firewall for sysadmin use but also because of 
    stupid Windows box</li>
    <li>Windows file server far from secure (or stable for that matter)</li>
    <li>Political issues involved in changing this</li>
    <li>DMZ was thought of, never achieved</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Rendering this into XACML would probably require at least five
policies.  Probably more for detailed stuff.  Assume list of financial
users is an environmental property.  Assume network location is a
subject property or whatever.</p>

<p>It would be <i>gratifying</i> if the Alloy solution would propose
my preferred solution (physical subnetting of the three separate
networks, separate fileserver would be ideal but impractical, so we'll
settle for secure fileserver, mail/DNS server on DMZ, all
communications between firewall and web server should be encrypted).
This was politically impossible and technically infeasable.</p>

<p>More details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only web server should be able to connect to database (not
physically possible due to stupid script, but nice in ideal)</li>
<li>Only blessed users can connect to conference management</li>
<li>Only blessed users can read/write email</li>
<li>Only financial users and scripts could connect to financial 
database</li>
<li>Only blessed users could connect to full file server</li>
<li>Only classroom users could connect to classroom stuff</li>
<li>No communication from office to firewall should be unencrypted</li>
</ul>
