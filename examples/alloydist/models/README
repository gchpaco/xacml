Description:
------------

This directory contains a variety of Alloy models.

Locations of models used in the CAV2002 submission are
given at the end of this file.

Contents:

published_systems/     Models of published systems; fairly complex and detailed models.
distalg/               Models of various distributed algorithms.  Relatively simple models.
puzzles/               Models of some well-known puzzles.  Useful for understanding Alloy semantics.
std/                   Standard library of polymorphic Alloy definitions.  Can be used by other models to
                       define commonly occurring structures such as total orders.  The analyzer has special
                       support for some of these models.
meta/                  Models of aspects of the Alloy analyzer.  Mostly of interest
                       to Alloy developers, although eventually we'll add meta-models
                       of the Alloy language which can help understand aspects
                       of the language.
