\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a formal model for access policies, and shown how to
analyze interesting properties about such models in an automated way.
We have implemented a tool to translate XACML policies into this model
and to yield code suitable for analysis.  The experimental results
indicate that automated analysis of nontrivial access policies is
feasible.

It would be interesting to investigate using predicate abstraction to
generate more precise models for the functions that we cannot directly
simulate.  We would also like to experiment on more and larger
policies.
