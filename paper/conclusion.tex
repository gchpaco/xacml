\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a formal model for access control policies, and
shown how to verify interesting properties about such models in an
automated way.  In particular we translate queries about access
control policies to Boolean satisfiability problems and use a SAT
solver to obtain an answer.  We express properties about access
control policies as subsumption queries between two policies.  We have
implemented a tool that 1) translates XACML policies to our formal
model and 2) translates subsumption queries between two XACML policies
to a Boolean satisfiability problem.  Our experimental results
indicate that automated verification of nontrivial access policies is
feasible using our approach.

In the future, it would be interesting to investigate using predicate
abstraction to generate more precise models for the functions that we
cannot directly simulate.  We would also like to experiment on more
and larger policies.
