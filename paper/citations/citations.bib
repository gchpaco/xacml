@mastersthesis{ford:packrat,
	Abstract = {Packrat parsing is a novel and practical method for implementing linear-time parsers for grammars defined in Top-Down Parsing Language (TDPL). While TDPL was originally created as a formal model for top-down parsers with backtracking capability, this thesis extends TDPL into a powerful general-purpose notation for describing language syntax, providing a compelling alternative to traditional context-free grammars (CFGs). Common syntactic idioms that cannot be represented concisely in a CFG are easily expressed in TDPL, such as longest-match disambiguation and 'syntactic predicates' making it possible to describe the complete lexical and grammatical syntax of a practical programming language in a single TDPL grammar. Packrat parsing is an adaptation of a 30-year-old tabular parsing algorithm that was never put into practice until now. A packrat parser can recognize any string defined by a TDPL grammar in linear time, providing the power and flexibility of a backtracking recursive descent parser without the attendant risk of exponential parse time. A packrat parser can recognize any LL(k) or LR(k) language, as well as many languages requiring unlimited lookahead that cannot be parsed by shift/reduce parsers. Packrat parsing also provides better composition properties than LL/LR parsing, making it more suitable for dynamic or extensible languages. The primary disadvantage of packrat parsing is its storage cost, which is a constant multiple of the total input size rather than being proportional to the nesting depth of the syntactic constructs appearing in the input. Monadic combinators and lazy evaluation enable elegant and direct implementations of packrat parsers in recent functional programming languages such as Haskell. Three different packrat parsers for the Java language are presented here, demonstrating the construction of packrat parsers in Haskell using primitive pattern matching, using monadic combinators, and by automatic generation from a declarative parser specification. The prototype packrat parser generator developed for the third case itself uses a packrat parser to read its parser specifications, and supports full TDPL notation extended with 'semantic predicates' allowing parsing decisions to depend on the semantic values of other syntactic entities. Experimental results show that all of these packrat parsers run reliably in linear time, efficiently support 'scannerless' parsing with integrated lexical analysis, and provide the user-friendly error-handling facilities necessary in practical applications.},

@article{merkle:helical,
	Abstract = {Helical logic is a theoretical proposal for a future computing technology using the presence or absence of individual electrons (or holes) to encode 1s and 0s. The electrons are constrained to move along helical paths, driven by a rotating electric field in which the entire circuit is immersed. The electric field remains roughly orthogonal to the major axis of the helix and confines each charge carrier to a fraction of a turn of a single helical loop, moving it like water in an Archimedean screw. Each loop could in principle hold an independent carrier, permitting high information density. One computationally universal logic operation involves two helices, one of which splits into two ``descendant'' helices. At the point of divergence, differences in the electrostatic potential resulting from the presence or absence of a carrier in the adjacent helix controls the direction taken by a carrier in the splitting helix. The reverse of this sequence can be used to merge two initially distinct helical paths into a single outgoing helical path without forcing a dissipative transition. Because these operations are both logically and thermodynamically reversible, energy dissipation can be reduced to extremely low levels. This is the first proposal known to the authors that combines thermodynamic reversibility with the use of single charge carriers. It is important to note that this proposal permits a single electron to switch another single electron, and does not require that many electrons be used to switch one electron. The energy dissipated per logic operation can likely be reduced to less than 10-27 joules at a temperature of 1 Kelvin and a speed of 10 gigahertz, though further analysis is required to confirm this. Irreversible operations, when required, can be easily implemented and should have a dissipation approaching the fundamental limit of ln 2 something kT.},

In the first part of this paper, we identify and illustrate the conceptual and practical reusability problems that arise with these forms of inheritance. We then present a simple compositional model for structuring object-oriented programs, which we call traits. Traits are essentially groups of methods that serve as building blocks for classes and are primitive units of code reuse. In this model, classes are composed from a set of traits by specifying glue code that connects the traits together and accesses the necessary state. We demonstrate how traits overcome the problems arising with the different variants of inheritance, we discuss how traits can be implemented effectively, and we summarize our experience applying traits to refactor an existing class hierarchy.},

@article{merkle:reversible,
	Abstract = {The continuing revolution in computer hardware is packing ever more logic gates in ever smaller volumes.   Unfortunately this produces ever more heat, which will limit the feasible packing density and performance unless the energy dissipated by each logic operation can also be dramatically reduced.  To reduce the energy dissipation of a logic operation below ln(2)kT (near thermal noise) requires the use of reversible logic for fundamental thermodynamic reasons.  Extrapolation of current trends suggest this limit will become significant within one to two decades.   Many real devices can be viewed as electrically controlled switches, so a method of using an abstract switch in a reversible manner is useful.  Two methods of using switches to implement reversible computations are discussed in this paper.  The first method has an energy dissipation which is proportional to the square of the error in the voltage, while the second method has an energy dissipation which can in principle be reduced indefinitely by slowing the speed of computation.  The first method is basically an extension to 'pass logic' which has been previously used with both nMOS (hot clock nMOS) and CMOS transmission gates to achieve low energy dissipation.  The second method is a novel thermodynamically reversible logic system based on CCD-like operations which switches charge packets in a reversible fashion to achieve low energy dissipation.},

In this paper we exploit the XML-based data model of SVG to present a model and a syntax aimed at selectively controlling access to graphic information on the Internet. Our model explicitly deals with the basic notions underlying representation of complex objects via vector graphics, while our enforcement technique efficiently exploits lower level DOM representation of XML data. },

Proponents of Java advocate its many advanced features and repeatedly claim there is some magic link and interdependence between web technology and Java as a programming language. The fabric of the web however, the open protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP and standards like HTML and XML, is in fact language-, operating-system, and vendor-neutral. It can be argued that Java is nothing new, and only a clever cocktail of features of several older technologies. ANSI Common Lisp provides nearly all of the advantages that make Java attractive, including automatic memory management, dynamic objectoriented programming and portability. Several other features including its interactivity and full dynamic typing make Lisp development a very different experience. It is my thesis that the venerable computer language Common Lisp is at least as capable as an implementation technology for web applications even though conceived and refined long before the internet revolution. I will show how some of Lisp's features, many which are not (yet) available in Java, make it a great platform to build web applications on. },

In this paper we examine the idea of  turning the act of collecting parameters from a user into a  first class object called a user interface continuation. Programs can create user interface continuations by specifying  what information is to be collected from the user and supplying a callback (i.e., a continuation) to be notified with the  collected information. A partially completed user interface  continuation can be saved as a new command, much as  currying and partially evaluating a function with a set of  parameters  produces  a  new  function.  Furthermore,  user  interface  continuations,  like  other  continuation-passing  paradigms, can be used to allow program execution to continue uninterrupted while the user determines a command's  parameters at his or her leisure.},

	Abstract = {Despite considerable advancements in the area of access control and authorization languages, current approaches to enforcing access control are all based on monolithic and complete specifications. This assumption is too restrictive when access control restrictions to be enforced come from the combination of different policy specifications, each possibly under the control of independent authorities, and where the specifics of some component policies may not even be known apriori. Turning individual specifications into a coherent policy to be fed into the access control system requires a nontrivial combination and translation process. This article addresses the problem of combining authorization specifications that may be independently stated, possibly in different languages and according to different policies. We propose an algebra of security policies together with its formal semantics and illustrate how to formulate complex policies in the algebra and reason about them. A translation of policy expressions into equivalent logic programs is illustrated, which provides the basis for the implementation of the algebra. The algebra's expressiveness is analyzed through a comparison with first-order logic.},

@article{damiani02fine,
	Abstract = {Web-based applications greatly increase information availability and ease of access, which is optimal for public information. The distribution and sharing of information via the Web that must be accessed in a selective way, such as electronic commerce transactions, require the definition and enforcement of security controls, ensuring that information will be accessible only to authorized entities. Different approaches have been proposed that address the problem of protecting information in a Web system. However, these approaches typically operate at the file-system level, independently of the data that have to be protected from unauthorized accesses. Part of this problem is due to the limitations of HTML, historically used to design Web documents. The extensible markup language (XML), a markup language promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is de facto the standard language for the exchange of information on the Internet and represents an important opportunity to provide fine-grained access control. We present an access control model to protect information distributed on the Web that, by exploiting XML's own capabilities, allows the definition and enforcement of access restrictions directly on the structure and content of the documents. We present a language for the specification of access restrictions, which uses standard notations and concepts, together with a description of a system architecture for access control enforcement based on existing technology. The result is a flexible and powerful security system offering a simple integration with current solutions.},

@inproceedings{jajodia01provisional,
	Abstract = {Past generations of access control systems, when faced with an access request, have issued a ``yes'' (resp. ``no'') answer to the access request resulting in access being granted (resp. denied). In this paper, we argue that for the world's rapidly proliferating business to business (B2B) applications and auctions, ``yes/no'' responses are just not enough. We propose the notion of a ``provisional authorization'' which intuitively says ``You may perform the desired access provided you cause condition C to be satisfied.'' For instance, a user accessing an online brokerage may receive some information if he fills out his name/address, but not otherwise. While a variety of such provisional authorization mechanisms exist on the web, they are all hardcoded on an application by application basis. We show that given (almost) any logic L, we may define a provisional authorization specification language . is based on the declarative, polynomially evaluable authorization specification language proposed by Jajodia et al. We define programs in , and specify how given any access request, we must find a ``weakest'' precondition under which the access can be granted (in the worst case, if this weakest precondition is ``false'' this amounts to a denial). We develop a model theoretic semantics for and show how it can be applied to online sealed-bid auction servers and online contracting. },

	Abstract = {An automatic analysis method for first-order logic with sets and  relations is described. A first-order formula is translated to a  quantifier-free boolean formula, which has a model when the  original formula has a model within a given scope (that is,  involving no more than some finite number of atoms). Because  the satisfiable formulas that occur in practice tend to have small  models, a small scope usually suffices and the analysis is efficient.  The paper presents a simple logic and gives a compositional  translation scheme. It also reports briefly on experience using the  Alloy Analyzer, a tool that implements the scheme.},

	Abstract = {We propose VAlloy, an extension to the first order, relational language Alloy. Alloy is suitable for modeling structural properties of object-oriented software. However, Alloy lacks support for dynamic dispatch, i.e., function invocation based on actual parameter types. VAlloy introduces virtual functions in Alloy, which enables intuitive modeling of inheritance. Models in VAlloy are automatically translated into Alloy and can be automatically checked using the existing Alloy Analyzer. We illustrate the use of VAlloy by modeling object equality, such as in Java. We also give specifications for a part of the Java Collections Framework.},

	Abstract = {Object modeling allows software designers and programmers to concisely describe the essence of a program's design, by describing program state.  Automatically extracting object models from code can be useful for many reasons: to summarize the architecture of the program, to resolve anomalies in the design, or even to find bugs.  This thesis describes Superwomble, a tool for automatically extracting object models from Java bytecode.  The object model is generated using an unsound type analysis on the code.  The unsoundness is an engineering tradeoff that in practice results in correct object models.  The tool also allows for automatic generation of abstract object models, by applying user-defined abstraction rules to the models.  The techniques for analysis and abstraction are defined, and are evaluated on some sample programs.},

@inproceedings{jackson01lightweight,
	Abstract = {A program's object model captures the essence of its design. For some programs, no object model was developed during design; for others, an object model exists but may be out-of-sync with the code. This paper describes a tool that automatically extracts an object model from the classfiles of a Java program. Unlike existing tools, it handles container classes, by inferring the types of elements stored in a container, and eliding the container itself. This feature is crucial for obtaining models that show the structure of the abstract state, and bear some relation to conceptual models. Although the tool performs only a simple, heuristic analysis that is almost entirely local, the resulting object model is surprisingly accurate. The paper explains what object models are and why they are useful; describes the analysis, its assumptions and limitations; evaluates the tool for accuracy, and illustrates its use, on a suite of sample programs. },

	Abstract = {A method for finding bugs in object-oriented code is presented.  It is capable of checking complex user-defined structural properties--that is, of the configuration of objects on the heap--and generates counterexample traces with no false alarms.  It requires no annotation beyond the specification to be checked, and is fully automatic.  The method relies on a three-step translation: from code to a formula in first-order relational logic, then to a propositional formula, and finally to conjunctive normal form.  An off-the-shelf SAT solver is then used to find a solution that constitutes a counterexample.  This underlying scheme, presented previously, does not scale readily.  In this paper we show how a suite of optimizations results in much improved scalability.  The optimizations are based on a special treatment of relations that are known to be functional, and target all steps.  The effect of the optimizations is demonstrated by application to the analysis of a red-black tree implementation.},
