The subexpression is not evaluated until the delay is forced. Then, when <code class="scheme">force</code> is applied to the result of the <code class="scheme"><span class="keyword">delay</span></code> expression, the subexpression is evaluated and the result of the subexpression is the result of the force. If the same delayed expression is forced a second time, the result of the first force is used again; the delayed subexpression is evaluated only once. <br /><p><a href="index.htm">Advanced Student Language</a></p></body></html>
