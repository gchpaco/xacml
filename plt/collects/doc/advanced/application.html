The initial expression should produce a procedure, and the remaining expressions are evaluated from left to right to yield the values that are passed as arguments to the procedure. The result of the application is the result of evaluating the procedure's body with every instance of an argument name replaced by the value provided for that argument. The number of argument expressions must be the same as the number of arguments expected by the procedure. <br /><p><a href="index.htm">Advanced Student Language</a></p></body></html>
