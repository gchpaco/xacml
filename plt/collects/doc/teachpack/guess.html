<h1>Guess</h1>

<hr> <h3><a name="guess.ss">guess.ss</a></h3> <!-- DOCNOTE="teach=guess.ss" -->

<p>The teachpack <code>guess.ss</code> provides operations to play a
guess-the-number game. Each operation display a GUI in which a player
can choose specific values for some number of digits and then check the
guess. The more advanced operations ask students to implement more of the
game. </p>

<p> The teachpack provides three operations:
<menu>
  <li><code><a name="guess-with-gui">guess-with-gui</a> : check-guess -> true; </code> <br>
  The check-guess function consumes two numbers: <code>guess</code>, which
  is the user's guess, and <code>target</code>, which is the randomly
  chosen number-to-be-guessed. The result is a symbol that reflects the
  relationship of the player's guess to the target.
  <br><br>

  <li><code><a name="guess-with-gui-3">guess-with-gui-3</a> : check-guess -> true; </code> <br>

  The check-guess function consumes three digits and one number:
  <code>digit0, digit1, digit2</code>, which make up the user's guess, and
  <code>target</code>, which is the randomly chosen
  number-to-be-guessed. The result is a symbol that reflects the
  relationship of the player's guess (the digits converted to a number) to
  the target.
  <br><br>

  Note: <code>digit0</code> is the <em>least</em> significant digit that
  the user chose and <code>digit2</code> is the <em>most</em> significant
  one.

  <li><code><a name="guess-with-gui-list">guess-with-gui-list</a> : check-guess -> true; </code> <br>

  The check-guess function consumes a list of digits and one number:
  <code>digits</code>, a list that makes up the user's guess, and
  <code>target</code>, which is the randomly chosen
  number-to-be-guessed. The result is a symbol that reflects the
  relationship of the player's guess (the digits converted to a number) to
  the target.
  <br><br>

  Note: the first item on <code>digits</code> is the <em>least</em>
  significant digit that the user chose, and the last one is the
  <em>most</em> significant digit.
